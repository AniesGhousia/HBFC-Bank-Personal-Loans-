HBFC Bank (Personal Loans)
This case is about a bank (HBFC Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these
customers are customers having deposits (Saving, Current) and Term Deposit (including Fixed
Deposits and Recurring deposit accounts) in the bank. The number of customers who are also
borrowers (customers having loan accounts) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding
this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest
on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its customers having
deposits to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).

The bank wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a
higher probability of purchasing the loan. For doing that, the first step in this regard is to explore
the previous data and drill insights.

You have been provided with a dataset of 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic
information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities
account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan).

You are brought in as a consultant and your job is to explore the data to understand the
variables and the impact they have had on Personal Loans so that the bank can leverage the
insights to reach out to the right customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the
loan.
